## **Color adaptation**

Color adaptation is the phenomenon in which the perception of color changes over time in response to changes in the environment. This can occur when an individual is exposed to different lighting conditions, such as moving from a bright outdoor environment to a dark indoor environment, or when an individual is exposed to different colors or color combinations.

One of the key factors that influences color adaptation is the intensity of the light that is present. When an individual is exposed to bright light, the cones in the eye that are responsible for sensing color become less sensitive, which can lead to a decrease in the perception of color saturation and an increase in the perception of contrast. On the other hand, when an individual is exposed to low light, the cones in the eye become more sensitive, which can lead to an increase in the perception of color saturation and a decrease in the perception of contrast.

Color adaptation can also be influenced by the colors that are present in the environment. For example, exposure to certain colors can lead to a change in the way that an individual perceives other colors. For example, exposure to the color blue can lead to an increased perception of coolness, while exposure to the color red can lead to an increased perception of warmth.

Color adaptation is an important factor to consider in the design of color schemes for products and environments, as it can affect the way that people perceive colors and can influence their mood and behavior. Designers can use color psychology principles and color theory techniques to create color schemes that are appropriate for different environments and situations, taking into account factors such as lighting conditions, the presence of other colors, and the intended emotional impact of the colors.

Color adaptation is a complex process that is influenced by a variety of factors, including the intensity and spectrum of the light that is present, the colors that are present in the environment, and the individual's prior experience and expectations. Some of the key factors that can influence color adaptation include:
* **_Lighting conditions:_** The intensity and spectrum of the light that is present can have a significant impact on the way that colors are perceived. For example, bright light can cause the cones in the eye to become less sensitive, which can lead to a decrease in the perception of color saturation and an increase in the perception of contrast. On the other hand, low light can cause the cones in the eye to become more sensitive, which can lead to an increase in the perception of color saturation and a decrease in the perception of contrast.
* **_Temperature:_** The temperature of the environment can also affect the way that colors are perceived. For example, warm colors (such as red, orange, and yellow) are typically associated with heat and energy, while cool colors (such as blue, green, and purple) are typically associated with calmness and tranquility.
* **_Culture:_** Cultural factors can also influence the way that colors are perceived. For example, in some cultures, certain colors are associated with luck or prosperity, while in other cultures, these same colors may be associated with negative emotions such as fear or mourning.
* **_Individual differences:_** Finally, individual differences in the way that the eye and brain process color can also influence color adaptation. Some people may be more sensitive to certain colors or may have a greater ability to perceive subtle differences in color, while others may be less sensitive or have a more limited range of color perception.

Overall, color adaptation is a complex process that is influenced by a variety of factors. Designers and researchers can use a variety of techniques, including psychophysical experiments and surveys, to study color adaptation and to understand how it can be used to create effective color schemes for different products and environments.

## **Color temperature**

Color temperature refers to the color of light emitted by a light source, measured in Kelvin (K). It describes how "warm" or "cool" the light appears to the human eye.

Color temperature is measured on a scale that ranges from around 1800 K (candlelight) to over 10,000 K (daylight). The Kelvin scale is used to specify the color temperature of light sources because the color of light is determined by the temperature of the emitting object, just like the color of an object on Earth is determined by its temperature. As the color temperature of a light source increases, the light appears to become "bluer" or "cooler". This is because cooler light sources emit more blue light and less red light. On the other hand, as the color temperature of a light source decreases, the light appears to become "warmer" or "yellowish". This is because warmer light sources emit more red light and less blue light.

In general, color temperature is an important consideration when choosing lighting for a particular application. For example, a cooler lighting scheme (around 4000 K or higher) is often used in commercial settings where a crisp, bright, and focused lighting is desired, while a warmer lighting scheme (around 2700 K or lower) is often used in residential settings where a cozy and inviting atmosphere is desired.

## **Chromaticity**

Chromaticity is a measure of the color of an object, typically expressed as the coordinates of its position on a color wheel. The color wheel is a tool used to describe the colors of an object in terms of their position in the visible spectrum of light. The x-axis of the color wheel represents the "long" wavelengths of light, while the y-axis represents the "short" wavelengths.

The chromaticity of an object is typically represented by two values: the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate. The x-coordinate is called the chroma, and it represents the purity or saturation of the color. The higher the chroma, the more pure or saturated the color. The y-coordinate is called the hue, and it represents the position of the color on the color wheel. The further the hue is from the center of the wheel, the more different it is from the colors at the center.

The chromaticity of an object is an important factor in color perception, as it helps the human eye to distinguish between different colors and to perceive the intensity and purity of those colors. It is also used in many fields, such as printing, television, and color measurement, to accurately describe and reproduce colors. Most often xy and xyY models are used to describe chromaticity values.

## **Tristimulus**

"Tristimulus" is a term that is used in color science to refer to the three types of receptors in the eye that respond to light of different wavelengths: the red, green, and blue (RGB) receptors. These receptors are sensitive to different parts of the spectrum of visible light, and they are responsible for the way that we perceive different colors.

The term "tristimulus" is derived from the fact that the human eye responds to stimulation from three different types of receptors, which are known as tristimulus cells. These cells are located in the retina of the eye and are responsible for converting light into electrical signals that are sent to the brain. The signals from the tristimulus cells are then interpreted by the brain to create the perception of different colors. The tristimulus cells are sensitive to different parts of the spectrum of visible light, with the red receptors being most sensitive to long wavelengths, the green receptors being most sensitive to medium wavelengths, and the blue receptors being most sensitive to short wavelengths.

The tristimulus model is the basis for many color models, including the CIE color space, which is used to standardize the way that colors are represented and measured. The CIE color space is based on the tristimulus model, and it defines a set of colors using three coordinates: the x-coordinate, which represents the amount of red light in the color; the y-coordinate, which represents the amount of green light in the color; and the z-coordinate, which represents the amount of blue light in the color.

The tristimulus model is also used in the creation of color reproduction devices, such as monitors and printers, to accurately reproduce colors in digital images. These devices use light-emitting diodes (LEDs) or other types of light sources to produce light of different wavelengths, and they use filters or other mechanisms to adjust the intensity of the light in different parts of the spectrum to reproduce the desired colors.

## **White point**

In the field of optics and photography, a white point is a specific color point in the color spectrum that is used as a reference for other colors. It is the point on the color spectrum where all colors appear white, and is used as a reference for calibrating color reproduction devices such as monitors, printers, and cameras. In simpler terms, it is the point on the color wheel where all colors appear to be the same shade of white.

In addition to being a reference point for color calibration, the white point can also be used to describe the overall color balance of an image or display. For example, if an image has a white point that is too cool (i.e. blue-tinged), it may appear unnatural and washed out. On the other hand, if an image has a white point that is too warm (i.e. yellow-tinged), it may appear too orange or red-toned. By adjusting the white point of an image or display, it is possible to achieve a more natural and balanced color representation.

Another important aspect of white points is that they can vary depending on the type of light source being used. For example, a white point for a fluorescent light source may be different from that of an incandescent light source. This is because different types of light sources emit light at different wavelengths, and the colors that appear white to our eyes can vary depending on the type of light being used. Understanding the white point of a light source is important for accurately reproducing colors in photography, video, and other visual media.
